By any chance if you are not seeing any preview, use **[⌥ + ⌘ + P]** to refresh the canvas.

If you are not seeing the canvas itself, make sure you are on Xcode 11.0+ version and on macOS Catalina.

You can also try **[⌥ + ⌘ + ↩]** to get canvas if your XCode and macOS are on supported versions.

Now you will be able to preview the project!
